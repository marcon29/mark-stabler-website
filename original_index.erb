	<h1>Two Minds Are Better In One</h1>
	<p>Right-brained. Left-brained. Seems to me, whole-brained is better. Logic or emotion? It always takes both. And once you realize this, you understand that writing is writing. Code. Copy. Poetry. The process to create them are almost identical. They have the same flow. You travel through them, line by line, and at the end, something should be transformed. Data in the case of code; sales in the case of copywriting; the reader in the case of poetry.</p>

	<h3>Soul of a Poet, Mind of an Engineer</h3>
	<p class="text-box">I wrote my first poem when I was seven. I published my first poem when I was twenty-two. But poetry doesn’t pay the bills. So I found a way to make writing a career: marketing copywriting. I had some good success for a while. I helped build some iconic brands. You’ve probably read my stuff. You just didn’t know it was mine. But even though I love words and the ideas they express, the marketing world no longer does. So I’m off to a new life as a programmer, something I’ve always dabbled in. This may seem like a dramatic switch, but writing all three forms, when done right, requires every word to serve some purpose, achieve some effect. Soon, not only will I be able to write the copy for your website or app, I’ll be able to build it, too. Happy to do both while I finish a collection of poetry. And I like whiskey.</p>
