# mark-stabler-website
Website for Mark Stabler (myself, the author) that serves as a central contact point and gateway to all of my main interests: programming, copywriting, literary pursuits. Essentially a simple landing page to provide some quick overall background about myself and direct people to a separate site for each main interest.

# Background
As a new developer, transitioning from a copywriting/marketing career, I needed a new website to make sense of my disparate interests. I also needed a more centralized and consistent way to be contacted regardless of interest. I also needed some simple practice in coding, so this website also serves as personal test environment to try things as I learn.
