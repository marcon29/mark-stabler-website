				<h3>Web Development</h3>
				<p>I’ve recently embarked on a new career in programming. I’ve taught myself basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. As a current software engineering student, I'll soon know Ruby and SQL as well. I can currently build functional websites (like this one), but I’m ultimately headed into app development.</p>

				<h3>Poetry, Short Stories &amp; Literary</h3>
				<p>When it comes to my literary writing, I operate by one basic concept. When you read these pages, the world should disappear. When you close these page and look around again, the world should be a different place.</p>

				<h3>Copywriting &amp; Brand Management</h3>
				<p>I help define brands. I create their voices and establish their main messaging. I carve that messaging into campaigns that run in all broadcast, digital, and print channels. But more importantly, I make sales happen.</p>

			<h3>Soul of a Poet, Mind of an Engineer</h3>
			<p>While we often think of poetry as filled with emotion, I always thought that writing poetry was one of the hardest logic exercises a person could do. It requires every word to serve some purpose, achieve some effect. With this idea in mind, I was able to write a couple poems that got published. But poetry doesn’t pay the bills. So I found a way for writing to be a career: marketing copywriting. I found some good success for a while. I helped build some iconic brands. But even though I love words, the marketing world no longer does. So I’m off to a new life as a programmer, something I’ve always dabbled in. This may seem like a major shift, but once you realize all things combine logic and emotion, you understand that writing is writing. Code. Copy. Poetry. The process to create them are almost identical. They have the same flow. You travel through them, line by line, and at the end something should be transformed. Data in the case of code; sales in the case of copywriting; the reader in the case of poetry.</p>
